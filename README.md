# SSHplex

**Multiplex your SSH connections with style**

SSHplex is a Python-based SSH connection multiplexer that provides a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) for selecting and connecting to multiple hosts simultaneously using tmux. Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, SSHplex integrates with NetBox as a Source of Truth and creates organized tmux sessions for efficient multi-host management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status

**SSHplex is currently in early development phase.** While the core functionality is working, this project is actively being developed and may have breaking changes between versions. Use at your own discretion in production environments.

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex.git
cd sshplex
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the sshplex directory
cd sshplex

# Install required packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# For development (optional)
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. First Run Configuration

On first run, SSHplex will automatically create the configuration directory and copy a template configuration file:

```bash
# First run - creates ~/.config/sshplex/sshplex.yaml
python3 sshplex.py
```

This will create:
- `~/.config/sshplex/` directory
- `~/.config/sshplex/sshplex.yaml` configuration file

### 4. Configure SSHplex

Edit the configuration file with your settings:

```bash
# Edit the configuration file
nano ~/.config/sshplex/sshplex.yaml
# or
vim ~/.config/sshplex/sshplex.yaml
```

**Key configuration sections:**

```yaml
# NetBox connection settings
netbox:
  url: "https://your-netbox-instance.com"
  token: "your-netbox-api-token"
  verify_ssl: true
  timeout: 30
  default_filters:
    status: "active"
    role: "virtual-machine"
    has_primary_ip: "true"

# SSH connection settings
ssh:
  username: "your-ssh-username"
  key_path: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"  # Path to your SSH private key
  timeout: 10
  port: 22

# tmux session settings
tmux:
  layout: "tiled"  # tiled, even-horizontal, even-vertical
  broadcast: false
  window_name: "sshplex"

# Logging settings (can be disabled)
logging:
  enabled: true
  level: "INFO"
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```

### 5. Run SSHplex

```bash
# Start with TUI interface (default)
python3 sshplex.py

# Use custom configuration file
python3 sshplex.py --config /path/to/custom-config.yaml

# CLI mode (NetBox connectivity test)
python3 sshplex.py --no-tui

# Show version
python3 sshplex.py --version
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start SSHplex**: Run `python3 sshplex.py`
2. **Select Hosts**: Use the TUI to browse and select hosts from NetBox
3. **Configure Session**: Choose between panes or windows, enable/disable broadcasting
4. **Connect**: SSHplex creates a tmux session and establishes SSH connections
5. **Work**: Use tmux commands to navigate between hosts
6. **Detach/Reattach**: Use `Ctrl+b d` to detach, `tmux attach` to reattach

### tmux Commands (once attached)

```bash
# Navigation
Ctrl+b + Arrow Keys    # Switch between panes
Ctrl+b + n/p          # Next/Previous window
Ctrl+b + 0-9          # Switch to window by number

# Session management
Ctrl+b + d            # Detach from session
tmux list-sessions    # List all tmux sessions
tmux attach -t <name> # Attach to specific session

# Pane management
Ctrl+b + x            # Close current pane
Ctrl+b + z            # Zoom/unzoom current pane
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### NetBox Filters

Customize which hosts are retrieved from NetBox:

```yaml
netbox:
  default_filters:
    status: "active"           # Only active hosts
    role: "virtual-machine"    # Only VMs
    platform: "linux"         # Only Linux hosts
    cluster: "production"      # Specific cluster
    has_primary_ip: "true"     # Only hosts with IP addresses
```

### tmux Layouts

Choose how SSH connections are arranged:

- `tiled`: Automatic tiling layout (default)
- `even-horizontal`: Horizontal split
- `even-vertical`: Vertical split

### Logging Control

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: false  # Disable logging completely
  level: "ERROR"  # Only show errors
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NetBox Connection Failed**
   - Verify URL and API token
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure SSL settings match your NetBox instance

2. **SSH Key Authentication Failed**
   - Verify SSH key path in configuration
   - Ensure key has proper permissions (`chmod 600`)
   - Test manual SSH connection to target hosts

3. **tmux Session Not Created**
   - Ensure tmux is installed and in PATH
   - Check SSH connectivity to at least one host
   - Verify tmux is not already running a session with the same name

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: true
  level: "DEBUG"
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```
